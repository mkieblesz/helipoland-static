## Setup

- sing up on [github.com](https://github.com)
- setup ssh key pair with `ssh-keygen` on your local machine and upload public key to your [github account settings](https://github.com/settings/keys)
- clone repository with `git clone git@github.com:mkieblesz/helipoland.git` to your workspace directory on your machine
- run `./scripts/install_hugo.sh; sudo mv hugo /usr/local/bin/` script to download other requirements to your local machine (you will be asked for root password)
- run `./scripts/install_tailwind.sh` script to install tailwindcss (you have to have node 12.x installed on your system)

## Development

### Workflow overview

Development happens accordingly to the following workflow.

1. Change website locally on your machine.
    - open command line in the project's root directory and run `hugo server` (this will run local development server. Website will be available at [http://localhost:1313/](http://localhost:1313/))
    - any changes to the files will re-render opened website served by hugo webserver in the browser automatically
    - to clean workspace from temporarily generated files run `./scripts/clean.sh`
2. Once happy with the changes, commit and push changes to github
    - `git add .` - this will add everything to staged changes
    - `git commit -m "Here is change description"` - this will commit changes to git locally
    - `git push` - this will push local commits to github
    - github deploy action will be triggered automatically after push - it will build hugo and deploy it to cdn
3. New version of the website should be available on [helipoland.com](https://helipoland.com).
